  <!-- context and action:
  - The website is going to consist of different types of teas from 
  around the world. I will be putting the most popular 
  and famous teas for each country. The website is going to have a world map 
   where the users will be able to hover over each country and get a gist of each countryâ€™s teas.
  - The action I want to utilise for this website is hover. So, when users hover over
  each country a information will popup about tea and its history. 
  Originally, I was going to use both hover and scroll however, the actions of what I wanted to do
  for hover and scroll were very different so, I just sticked with hover. -->
<!-- 
  For the chosen context of teas around the world and the action of hover, I think the action
  hover guides the context very well since there is a lot of information about each country's teas
  and this also helps to keep the webpage more minimal so that users don't have to scroll like wikipedia
  to read boring information. I think it is a good interaction and keeps the users engaged by moving
  the mosue to hover over each country.  -->

  <!-- Colour and aesthetic:

  For the colours I wanted to go with a more exotic but magical colour scheme so,
  I went with the colours aqua blue, purple and yellow. 

  For the aesthetic I wanted a more minimalistic and simple design for the main page
  so, the users could easily see the hover information easily. -->

I wanted a message that would inform the users that they can hover over the countries
to see more information about tea around the world. I also added a closing button so 
it would look more clean after. -->

    <!-- pins and country:
    For the pins and countries on top of the world map I wanted it to be more
    noticeable but subtle. 
    When you hover over the countries you will see a information popup of the different
    teas. I created the information tabs on canva and illustrated the teas on procreate. 
    The informations and descriptions on the tabs are from these websites for credit:
